I hope this is the last tutorial I need to give on how to install this on iOS 5.x:

Use putty for windows, a terminal for OS X or linux, or this app for iOS devices Serverauditor

ssh root@ipaddress    <--------replace ipaddress with your aTV ip address for example mine is ssh root@192.168.1.101
default aTV password = alpine

Follow these easy terminal commands. I have installed this on multiple atv2's and so have others, set your dns to auto not manual. This automates nearly the entire aTV plexconnect installation for you. ssh into your Atv and enter these commands after your navigated to the folder where you placed them (nitoTV is the easiest way to install openssh for ssh access, also server auditor):

apt-get -y install git
rm -R /Applications/atvjailbreak
cd /Applications
git clone git://github.com/wahlmanj/atvjailbreak.git
cd /Applications/atvjailbreak
chmod +x installibaa.bash
./installbaa.bash

or

apt-get -y install git
rm -R /Applications/atvjailbreak
cd /Applications
git clone git://github.com/wahlmanj/atvjailbreak.git
cd /Applications/atvjailbreak
chmod +x installwahlmanj.bash
./installwahlmanj.bash


# dpkg -i ibaa.deb

##once complete the aTV will reboot and you will have a new plexconnect button. Just sign into myplex and you should be all set.

##Optional options log back in to your atv via ssh after your atv reboots and type this if you want more apps by spoofing your iOS version to a higher IOS:
cd /Applications/atvjailbreak
dpkg -i spoof.deb

Hopefuly the autoupdate plist works if not you can manually update by typing this into a terminal window after you ssh into your atv:

update.bash

You must be successfully signed into myplex in PMS. Also you must have your port forwarded and pointed at your PlexConnect host for this to work right on your router tcp/udp. If PlexConnect resides behind for example a synology box you must open these ports as well for it to work outside your lan.

If you do not require it to work outside you lan edit your settings.cfg file on the aTV to enable_plexgdm = True
